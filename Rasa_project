Rasa is an open-source framework for building conversational AI. It provides a complete toolset for building, deploying and improving chatbots and virtual assistants. It's designed to be highly customizable and flexible, allowing developers to use it for a wide range of use cases.

In a Rasa chatbot project, the chatbot's functionality is built using two main components:

- Rasa NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is used for understanding the intent and entities in the user's input. It uses machine learning to extract meaning from text and it's trained using a set of labeled examples.
- Rasa Core handles the conversation flow and dialogue management. It uses a set of rules and machine learning models to decide on the next action to take in a conversation.
Rasa also provides Rasa X, which is a web-based tool for managing and improving your chatbot. It allows you to view conversation logs, analyze user feedback, and make changes to your chatbot without having to write any code.

- The Rasa NLU and Core models, which include the trained models and any configuration files.
- The training data for the NLU models, which includes the labeled examples used to train the models.
- The actions code, which includes the code for any custom actions that the chatbot can perform.
- The credentials and environment variables files.
- The chatbot script or the endpoint code that allows the chatbot to interact with the user.
